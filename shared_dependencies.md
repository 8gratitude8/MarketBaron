The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is a shared dependency across all the files. It is used to create components and manage the application's state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the files for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used to define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values.

4. **React-DOM**: This is used in "_document.tsx" and "_app.tsx" files for rendering the application on the client side.

5. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of all the dependencies and scripts for the application. It is shared by all the files as they all depend on the packages listed in this file.

6. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is shared by all the TypeScript files (".tsx" files).

7. **CSS**: The "globals.css" file is shared by all the pages for styling.

8. **Public assets**: The "favicon.ico" and "vercel.svg" files in the public directory are shared by all the pages as they are used in the layout of the application.

9. **Function names**: The function names like "getInitialProps", "getServerSideProps", "getStaticProps" are shared across the pages as they are used for data fetching in Next.js.

10. **Component names**: The component names like "App", "Document", "Head", "Main", "NextScript" are shared across the pages as they are used for structuring the application in Next.js.
