1. React: All the .js files are likely to be React components, so they will share the React dependency.

2. ReactDOM: The public/index.html file will likely use ReactDOM to render the root React component.

3. CSS Modules: If the project uses CSS Modules, each component may have its own .css file that it imports.

4. Shared Components: The Header.js and Footer.js files are likely to be used in multiple pages (Home.js, About.js, Contact.js, Services.js), so these components are shared dependencies.

5. Shared Variables: There may be shared variables or constants, such as a site title or base URL, that are used across multiple files.

6. Shared Functions: There may be shared utility functions that are used across multiple files, such as a function to replace "NFT" with "Independent Game".

7. Shared State: If the app uses React's context API or a state management library like Redux, there may be shared state that is accessed by multiple components.

8. Shared Services: If the app communicates with a backend, there may be shared services or API clients that are used by multiple components.

9. Shared Routes: If the app uses a router like React Router, there may be shared route names or paths that are used in multiple components, such as the Navbar.js and Sidebar.js components.

10. Shared Event Names: If the app uses an event bus or similar mechanism for inter-component communication, there may be shared event names that are used in multiple components.

11. Shared DOM Element IDs: If any JavaScript functions directly manipulate the DOM, there may be shared DOM element IDs that are used in multiple files.
